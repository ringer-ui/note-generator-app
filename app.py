    Use the information in the document provided below to draft an ER physician note with the following structure. Fill in the placeholders (e.g., @DEPTNME@, @ED@) with the relevant information from the document. If information for a specific field is not available in the document, write "Not Available". As part of the summary narrative, include a focused differential for the presenting complaint, and exclude all but the final diagnosis implied by the note, and provide a rationale for finding the other diagnoses to be unlikely. Use CDRs where available. Suppress the patient's name from the note as well as their address. The only PHI should be their DOB and MRN.
